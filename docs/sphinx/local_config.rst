Configuration
*************

In order to use this truthing protocol, users should have the following software:
 
 * `CAJAL Toolbox <http://github.com/openconnectome/cajal>`_
 * `NIFTI Tools (distributed as part of CAJAL) <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image>`_
 * `ITK-Snap v 3.x <http://www.itksnap.org/>`_
 * A recent version of MATLAB
 
*This tool uses ITK-Snap for annotating, and MANNO+CAJAL to pull and push data appropriately.  It is not necessary for all annotators to use MATLAB and CAJAL, as long as they have a mechanism (such as a grad student) to help pull and push data.  Annotators only need to be able to load, annotate, and save within ITK Snap.*
