This project is part of the `Open Connectome Project <openconnecto.me/>`_.  The following information that applies across our projects.

Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

m2g is under active development.  To contribute new algoirthms, either get in touch with us directly, or clone our git repo and issue a pull request. Prior to contributing, checkout some of our dev branches to see if some of your suggestions are already being implemented. To issue a pull request, head over to our repository and select the pull requests option on the righthand side, then issue a new pull request. If you're unfamiliar with github, there are many google-able guides available which are very helpful.

Our workflows are modular and flexible, and we are especially interested in incorporating tools that others use and find valuable for processing brains. We are also excited to deploy m2g on new datasets with interesting covariates. We are not only interested in te generation of graphs, but also the inference of covariates and phenotypic information from training classifiers with estimated graphs.

Please let us know if you'd like to contribute by contacting us through email.
